# S&P 500 Stock Prices Prediction

This project explores and predicts stock prices for the S&P 500 index using Python. It demonstrates the process of data analysis, visualization, and modelling, making it a valuable addition to a Data Analyst's portfolio.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
- Loading and preprocessing stock price data from a CSV file.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Applying predictive modeling techniques to forecast stock prices.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset structure and key statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Insights into trends and patterns using plots.
- **Model Building**: Predictive models to forecast future stock prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## File Structure
- `Prices.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `S&P 500 Stock Prices 2017.csv`: Dataset used in the analysis.
- `model`: Saved file with the model used in the project.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure the dataset (`S&P 500 Stock Prices 2017.csv`) is available in the working directory.
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
   ```
4. Open the notebook and run the cells.

## Acknowledgments
This project uses publicly available stock price data for educational and demonstration purposes.
